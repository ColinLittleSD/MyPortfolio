            <p>About Me</p>
            <p>Developer In Training & Avid Outdoorsman</p>
            <p>Hey, my name is Colin Little. I am currently learning .NET, C#, and html. 
                I am driven to better my future, especially post-covid, and software development
                has always been something that interested me. I prefer working with groups and 
                thrive in team-oriented environment. I love meeting, and talking to people, boucning 
                ideas off eachother. That is a major factor in this field, so I just went for it. 
                I went to college at Michigan State University, where I recieved my Bachelor's in 
                Environmental Geosciences. I have had jobs in logistics, as well as Wetland science
                and restoration since graduation. I love spending time outside. I love hunting, fishing, 
                hiking, camping, and adventure. I have traveled to 8 countries and want to continue 
                seeing the world. </p>
            <p>If you would like to contact me to work on a project, or hire for work, please do so. 
                I look forward to helping you on your project.</p>
